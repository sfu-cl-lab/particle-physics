Evaluate standard machine classifiers on particle reaction data. Under construction.

Posts a data set of particle reactions labelled as "possible" or "impossible". Runs standard classifiers on this set and compares to the null space method (see paper [Simultaneous Discovery of Conservation Laws and Hidden Particles With Smith Matrix Decomposition](http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~oschulte/pubs.html). The hypothesis is that on this dataset, domain knowledge beats algorithm.
